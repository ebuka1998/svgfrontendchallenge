Some edge cases that could go wrong

A user when computing the radius of the circle can give a large figure and that would make the 
radius of the circle to go beyond the specified cy and cx in the svg. to solve this I provided
a dropdown so that they can select to a given range of values.

when drawing a square a user might specify different lengths of values for the height and lengths

drawing a polygon uses points. A user might not know how to compute the points but an example was given
as a placeholder.

the value is stored as objects in localstorage, if this is deleted and on refresh the app will loose its
persistance but as soon as a user starts drawing, it will save again and it will persist.
